What's on show here across the presentation is an effort to bring together various different design aesthetics, from existing brand material, the sites that were listed as references, as well as notes from the first session. Ideally all of this combined into a clean, modern aesthetic that vastly improves the current site design and experience.</p><p>The flow of the homepage is logical, opening like most with a large hero section with tagline text that invites the visitor to continue scrolling. From there we have an introduction section paired with one of the provided illustrations. This sits just above three large image links that, while currently are set up to point to Admissions, Academics, and Student Life, they can indeed point anywhere deemed fit. Statistics follows, pulling in existing numbers on the School Profile PDF, it's framed nicely with another illustration behind them.<p>We then segue into an events section, utilizing calendar events to show off what's happening currently at the school. Below this is another chance to feature content with a rotating single item carousel, once again framed nicely with the last illustration. The page itself is rounded out by three call to action image links along with a fairly standard footer</p>",
